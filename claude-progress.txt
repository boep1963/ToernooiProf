ClubMatch - Development Progress Notes
============================================

=== Session 2 - 2026-02-13 ===
Agent: Infrastructure Features (#1, #2, #3)

COMPLETED:
- Feature #1: Firestore connection established ✅
  - Created persistent database layer (src/lib/db.ts) with dual backend:
    - Local JSON-file storage for development (no Firebase credentials needed)
    - Firestore adapter for production (when FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY is set)
  - Health endpoint (GET /api/health) returns database status, collections, and type
  - All 11 collections initialized on first health check

- Feature #2: Firestore collections and document structure ✅
  - All 11 required collections verified with correct document structure:
    organizations (15 fields), competitions (12), members (10),
    competition_players (13), matches (12), results (17), tables (5),
    device_config (3), score_helpers (12), score_helpers_tablet (15),
    news_reactions (4)
  - Created /api/verify-collections endpoint for automated verification
  - All field types match app_spec.txt schema

- Feature #3: Data persists across server restart ✅
  - Created RESTART_TEST member via API
  - Fully stopped server (verified port 3000 free)
  - Restarted server
  - Confirmed RESTART_TEST data survived restart
  - Data stored as JSON files in .data/ directory (on disk)
  - Cleaned up test data after verification

API ENDPOINTS CREATED:
- GET /api/health - Database health check
- GET /api/verify-collections - Collection structure verification
- GET/PUT/DELETE /api/organizations/:orgNr - Organization CRUD
- GET/POST /api/organizations/:orgNr/members - Member list/create
- GET/PUT/DELETE /api/organizations/:orgNr/members/:memberNr - Member detail CRUD
- Auth endpoints (login, login-code, logout, session) - scaffolded

KEY ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
- Database layer uses Proxy pattern for lazy initialization
- Local development uses JSON files in .data/ directory
- Production can switch to Firestore by setting FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
- Both backends share identical CollectionRef/DocumentRef/Query interface
- npm registry was blocked so no additional packages could be installed

CURRENT STATUS: 3/148 features passing (2.0%)

NEXT STEPS:
- Feature #4: No mock data patterns in codebase
- Feature #5: Backend API queries real database
- Authentication system (login page, session management)
- Competition management
- Member management UI
