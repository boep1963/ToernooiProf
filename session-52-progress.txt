Agent: Feature #188 - Matrix page defaults to periode 1

COMPLETED:
- Feature #188: Matrix page defaults to periode 1 instead of current competition periode ✅

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:

**Problem:**
The matrix page was initializing selectedPeriode to compData.periode (the competition's current/active periode). For competitions where the current periode has little data, this meant users saw an empty or sparse matrix on first load. Users expect to see the most data-rich periode first.

**Solution:**
Changed the initial value of selectedPeriode from compData.periode to 1 (hardcoded).

**Code Changes:**
File: src/app/(dashboard)/competities/[id]/matrix/page.tsx (lines 108-109)
- Before: Initialized to compData.periode with fallback
- After: Always initialized to 1

**Verification:**
- Navigated to /competities/3/matrix
- Confirmed page shows "Periode 1" in subtitle
- Confirmed matrix table displays with periode 1 data
- Periode selector buttons render correctly
- Zero console errors
- Browser automation screenshots captured
