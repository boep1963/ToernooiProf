FEATURE #126: Competition data validation (Controle) - IN PROGRESS
- Researched PHP source code for Controle.php
- Found system-level orphaned record checker (not competition-specific)
- Needs implementation of competition-specific validation:
  * All players have valid moyennes
  * All matches have valid player references
  * Match results are complete
  * Periods correctly configured
  * No duplicate pairings
- Feature requires more time to implement properly
